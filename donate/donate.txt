            <br>
            <p>
                We have been able to thrive due to the support of our generous community.

            <p>
                All donations we receive are duly accounted for, with a stewardship report made availabe to the parishioners by the aegis of the Parish Laity Council. We are always grateful for whatever we receive, as it goes a long way to the organisation of the parish as a whole, as well as our charity outreaches and miscellaneous programs.
